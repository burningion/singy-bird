# Singy Bird (Voice Controlled Flappy Bird)

This repo uses the great [FlaPyBird](https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird) repo to work from. We use the base images and the logic from that game as our starting point, so we can mostly focus on building a voice controlled application, not implementing Flappy Bird from scratch.

## Requirements

We use PyAudio, NumPy, Music21, PyGame, and Aubio to do all voice analysis and drawing to the screen. You'll need to have all of these libraries installed in order to get everything to work.

Most of this should be `pip` installable.
