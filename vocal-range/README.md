In this multipart blog post about building a musical game, we'll need to first establish our player's vocal range of possible notes they can sing.

This repository establishes that vocal range, using Pygame in the window size of our end result Flappy Bird.

## Running the Game

```bash
$ python3 vocal-range.py -input 7
```
